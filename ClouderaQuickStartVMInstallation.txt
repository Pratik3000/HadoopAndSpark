Single node CLoudera Based Cluster:
----------------------------------

Get the cloudera Quickstart VM from Google Virtual Box Version (VMDK File):
https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-13.html

Start VM Box--> File --> Import Appliance--> Select the Cloudera VM that we downloaded--> Check Specs--> Import
[2 CPU Cores and 5GB RAM should be enough for our use to explore the working of Coudera Distribution]

Select the machine that we imported
Settings--> Change the RAM (5GB), CPU cores (4) and NAT Gateway

Start the machine
[In Cloudera Distribution, there are Cloudera SCM Servers and Cloudera SCM Agents running that takes care of starting the Services]
[In Cloudera Quickstart VM, we have only 1 SCM Server and 1 SCM Agent that takes care of setting up the Services on Cluster]


Inside Cloudera VM check>
Open Terminal--> 
$ hostname
quickstart.cloudera

$ hdfs dfs -ls /

$ service cloudera-scm-server status (also check using $ sudo su)
It suggests using Express edition--> go to Cloudera Express--> copy following command and paste it in the terminal

$ sudo /home/cloudera/cloudera-manager --force --express
(restarts the services, only after which we have the access to the cloudera cluster)

--==================
# after the cloudera services have restarted follow the following steps

Open Browser --> quickstart.cloudera:7180
cloudera/cloudera

Inside console, Remove some services since we do not have enough ram in the VM box (Key-Value Store, Solr(remove from HUE First), Sqoop2, Sqoop1,  )
1.	If the service we are trying to remove is running it gives us the prompt to stop the service first
2.	If the service was dependent on other service it will prompt to remove the dependent service first

Health Issues: 
1	Clock Offset (NTP Service)(used to keep multiple machines in the cluster in sync (can be suppressed for single node Cloudera VM))

Configuration Issues:
1. Zookeeper --> only 1 available, min 3 reqd
2. Hue --> Has 0 LB, suggested atleast 1
3. HDFS --> Only 1 DN, Suggested at least 3
4. HDFS --> in Bytes, suggested 1GB for 1Mil Blocks (Min Value suggested, 4GB)
5. Hive --> 1 is less than minimum 4 recommended
6. HiveServer2 --> 1 is less than minimum 4 recommended
7. quickstart.cloudera --> 

Start Cluster:
Clusters--> Actions--> Restart
